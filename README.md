# quiz_app

A flutter app built for learning purposes.

## Description:

In this a basic quiz app, where questions will be displayed to the user and user can only answer 
true or false.

The results are recorded and at the end, the user is given their score and ask if they'd like to try again.

The Goals here were to:
- Become familiar with the basics of dart classes.
- How to modularize code with classes and import them from local files.
- Learn how to use alert dialogs.
- Re-enforce knowledge of darts type system and lists.

## Opportunities for expansion:
With a bit of work, this project could be expanded into:
- A flashcard based app.
- Using a Quiz API you could get new lists of questions after every game.
